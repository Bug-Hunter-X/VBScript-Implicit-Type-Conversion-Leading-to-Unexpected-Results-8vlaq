# VBScript Implicit Type Conversion Bug
This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit type conversion and a lack of robust error handling.  The `MyFunction` attempts addition, but doesn't explicitly check or handle non-numeric input, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected results.

The solution showcases improved error handling and explicit type checking for safer and more predictable code.
